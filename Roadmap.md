## Risk Mitigation
### Identified Risks
- **LLM API reliability**: Implement fallback mechanisms
- **Vector database performance**: Monitor and optimize queries
- **Docker complexity**: Simplify deployment with clear documentation
- **Time constraints**: Prioritize core RAG functionality over features

### Contingency Plans
- Keep simple file-based vector storage as backup
- Prepare simpler UI if React development takes too long
- Have local LLM option ready if API integration fails
