# BAH RAG Demo - Enterprise AI Solution

## Project Overview
Enterprise-grade RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation showcasing full-stack development capabilities, LLM framework expertise, and microservices architecture design aligned with digital modeling product requirements.

## Core Requirements

### Architecture
- Dockerized microservices architecture
- React frontend
- Node.js backend
- Document upload and vectorization pipeline
- RAG implementation with citations and logging

### Technology Stack
- **LLM Frameworks**: LangChain and LlamaIndex for RAG orchestration
- **Model Registries**: Hugging Face integration for model management
- **LLM Integration**: Open Router API with fallback to Hugging Face Inference
- **Vector Database**: Production-ready integration (Pinecone/Chroma/Weaviate)
- **Embeddings**: Multiple embedding models via LangChain adapters
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js RESTful API architecture
- **Containerization**: Docker with docker-compose for microservices orchestration
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Cloud-Ready**: AWS/Azure compatible architecture patterns

### Functional Requirements
1. Secure document upload with validation and error handling
2. Advanced document processing pipeline using LangChain/LlamaIndex
3. Intelligent text chunking and vectorization strategies
4. React-based chat interface with TypeScript type safety
5. RAG-powered responses with accurate source citations
6. Comprehensive logging system for debugging and monitoring
7. RESTful API design with proper error codes and responses
8. Microservices communication via Docker networking
9. Environment-based configuration management
10. Health checks and service monitoring endpoints

### Development Commands & DevOps
- Use `npx supabase` for any Supabase operations
- Docker containers for each microservice with proper networking
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD pipeline
- Comprehensive error handling with structured logging
- Environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/prod)
- Automated testing for critical RAG functionality
- Service health monitoring and auto-restart policies

## Design Principles & Architecture
- **Microservices Architecture**: Independently deployable services with clear boundaries
- **Software Solution Design**: Client-focused requirements implementation
- **Full-Stack Development**: End-to-end feature implementation from UI to data layer
- **Security Considerations**: Input validation, secure API design, secrets management
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities with stateless services
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript for type safety, ESLint for consistency
- **Documentation**: Clear API contracts and architecture decisions
- **Performance**: Optimized vector search and caching strategies
- **Observability**: Structured logging, metrics, and monitoring
- **Modularity**: Reusable components and services for extensibility
